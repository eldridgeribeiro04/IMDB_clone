# REST-framework-course
With the help of djangos rest framework, I have created a clone of the IMDB website.
Ofcourse, this was done as an intention to learn REST framework.
In this project a user can view or create ratings for a movie/show.
A show or movie can only be added by an admin. This was done by using validators.
A show can only be reviewed by a user once.
The project currently does not have a frontend but I have used postman to visualize how the program works.
